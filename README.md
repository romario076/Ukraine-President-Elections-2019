### Regression analysis for Ukraine president election in 2019.

<hr>

For this analysis were used election results (elextions2019.xlsx) for both candidates:
<li> Poroshenko 
<li> Zelenskiy

And result of EIT (ZNO in Ukraine) or External independent testing (Zno2018.xlsx) of Histry of Ukraine, is the examination for admission to universities in Ukraine.

Of course, students that passes EIT dont have 18 years and doesnt have rights to take a part in elections, but we will use this as metric to measure the region education level.

And it is completely kake sence.

Both Zno2018.xlsx, and elextions2019.xlsx are distributed by region and can be used for joining together.

For analysis were used classical mathematical approaches such as:
<li>Correlation
<li>Linear Regression

### Results

<hr>

For the pictures below, easy to see that we received very interesting result.

For candidate Poroshenko we see completely normal situation and normal behaviour of data. 

The higher history of Ukraine education rate in region the more percets of votes he received in this specific region

For candidate Zelenskiy, we easy to see a completely opposite situation. The lower history of Ukraine education rate in the region the more percent of votes he received.

So, this is a classic case of populism and lies during an election campaign.

Because the less educated a person is, the easier it is to convince, deceive, and control them.

Years after th—ñs elections, it is easy to see that these results were absolutely true.
